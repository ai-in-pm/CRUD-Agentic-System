# AI-Driven CRUD Management System

A collaborative AI agent system for efficient database management using six specialized agents for data operations, security, and analytics.

## System Architecture

The system consists of six AI agents working together:

1. **Data Ingestion & Creation Agent**
   - Handles data entry and ingestion
   - Validates data integrity
   - Manages record creation

2. **Data Retrieval & Query Agent**
   - Optimizes read operations
   - Processes natural language queries
   - Manages efficient data retrieval

3. **Data Update & Integrity Agent**
   - Handles record updates
   - Maintains data consistency
   - Tracks historical changes

4. **Data Security & Compliance Agent**
   - Implements RBAC
   - Manages data encryption
   - Ensures regulatory compliance

5. **Data Analytics & Insights Agent**
   - Generates real-time analytics
   - Detects anomalies
   - Provides data insights

6. **Orchestration & Coordination Agent**
   - Coordinates inter-agent communication
   - Manages workflow execution
   - Provides system oversight
